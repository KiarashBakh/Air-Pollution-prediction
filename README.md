# Time Series Prediction Project in R
This repository contains a time series prediction project implemented in R, focusing on forecasting data obtained from Kaggle's databases. The project is structured to predict data for each city separately.

## Overview
Time series prediction is a crucial task in various domains, offering insights into future trends based on historical data. In this project, we leverage datasets available on Kaggle to perform predictive analysis for different cities.

## Features
* City-wise Prediction: The project is designed to forecast time series data for each city individually, allowing for more tailored and accurate predictions.
* Data Exploration: We provide comprehensive data exploration techniques to understand the underlying patterns and trends within the time series data.
* Modeling Techniques: Various modeling techniques are implemented, including but not limited to ARIMA.
